# Hey, I’m Siddhanta!
A “visionary” deep learning disruptor coding on my sticker-covered MacBook in SF cafés. I overengineer ML models to “pivot paradigms” while sipping oat milk lattes and pretending to grok Kubernetes. Let’s build a unicorn—or at least a pitch deck.

# "Experience"
Supreme Overlord of Neural Hyper-Synergy at the Foundation for Infinite Scalability. Former Chief Jargon Generator at StartUpHypeCorp, where I “disrupted the status quo” by pushing to prod on Fridays.

# Currently Building
- NeuralHypeNet: AI that generates buzzwords faster than a VC.
- JiraSlayer: Bot to auto-close tickets and skip standups.
- EspressoOptimizer: Microservice for peak latte frothiness.

# Fun Fact
If “disruptive innovation” trends on GitHub, I’ll switch to TempleOS and go full digital monk (or maybe just Fedora).
