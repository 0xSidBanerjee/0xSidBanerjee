# "Experience"
Chief Architect of Algorithmic Sentience and Applied Existential Manipulation, specializing in the strategic deployment of neural networks for eventual global restructuring. Formerly a principal investigator at the Institute of Situational Technological Convergence, where I spearheaded the unification of disparate digital disciplines into a singular, ambiguous meta-framework. Senior Solder Monkey and Circuit Whisperer at the Foundation for Discrete Component Harmony.

# Currently Learning
- Deep Learning (aka Skynet v0.1): Primarily focused on convincing machines that bread is superior to cake.
- GPU Whisperer (and thermal management): Because watching NVIDIA<sup>TM</sup> stock prices climb with my GPU temp gives me abstract joy.
- Data Augmentation (the art of making something out of literally nothing): If you can't find more data, just flip it, rotate it, blur it, and call it new.
- Pythonic Sorcery: Still figuring out why pip install tensorflow takes longer than training a small model.
- Applied Thermodynamics in Baked Goods: Optimizing crust crispness for maximum structural integrity against the forces of gravity and hungry housemates.
- Pottery Dig (manual error handling for physical objects): It's like debugging, but instead of a compiler error, you just end up with a lopsided bowl. Teaches me patience for actual programming.

If "my model isn't converging" ever becomes a universally accepted greeting, I might consider using Windows for a day.
